# Shannon diversity analysis
_Analysis of archaeological data using Shannon diversity index (in progress)_

I'm assisting Prof. Kevin Dicus (University of Oregon) with code for the statistical analyses for his upcoming book on waste management systems in the ancient Roman world. Some of the code was adapted from David L. Carlson's _Quantitative Methods in Archaeology Using R_ (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2017).

In this repo you'll find:
* An R script that takes in a table of artifact counts per stratigraphic unit (SU), calculates the Shannon diversity index and Pielou's J (a measure of evenness in assemblages) for each SU, and prints a scatter plot of the resulting values.
* A Jupyter Notebook used to generate additional visualizations.
* A few graphics.

This is a work in progress. Prof. Dicus intends to publish all his data and code in a repository of his own when the book goes to print.
